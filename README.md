# How to run
1. Download the files (index.html and main.js) and put them in one folder.
2. Open index.html with any browser.
3. Type user data in the fields and click Add User.

Note: the result of the unit test will be displayed in the console.

Clicking the Show All button will display the data of all users currently created. Against each row there will be two options - 
Edit and Delete. Clicking the Delete button will remove the user. When clicking the Edit button the data of the user will 
be put in the fields. You are able to modify the email, first and last names. On clicking the Save Changes button the 
data will be modified. Button Cancel Edit resets the form fields and cancels the edit.

You are also able to search for users by name. The result will be displayed in the table below the Show All button.
For example, if you try search by 'vik' (without the quotes) will display all results containing the string 'vik' either in
the first or the last name.
